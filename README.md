## 🛠 Built With

This app was botstrapped using [Create T3 App](https://create.t3.gg/)⭐️, which accelerated its development. It was important to have type safety across the network chasm and within a single repository, so I reached for the T3 stack and I was not disappointed. The specific tools I used are below.
